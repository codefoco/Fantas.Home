Fantas is a 2D graphics rendering and animation framework for .NET. It is designed to make it easy for developers to create 2D games and interactive apps for Desktop and mobile devices.

Fantas uses a node-based system to create and render 2D graphics. Nodes are objects that represent a visual element or piece of content in a Fantas Scene. They can be used to create and animate sprites (2D images), display text, play sounds, and perform other actions.

Fantas also includes a physics engine that can be used to simulate realistic physics in a 2D environment, as well as a particle generator for creating special effects like explosions or particle trails.

Overall, Fantas is a powerful tool for building 2D games and interactive experiences on mobile or Desktop.

Fantas is cross platform and support Android, iOS/tvOS, macOS, Linux and Windows.
